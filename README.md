Welcome to the Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples repository. This repository contains a collection of Java files that demonstrate various fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, packages, synchronization, and more. Each Java file in the respective folder showcases a specific concept to help you understand and practice these concepts.

Table of Contents:
Basic OOP Concepts: This file introduces the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming, including class declaration, object instantiation, and method invocation.

Encapsulation: Explore how to encapsulate data and behavior within a class, ensuring controlled access through methods and modifiers.

Inheritance: Learn about creating a class hierarchy using inheritance, allowing the subclass to inherit fields and methods from the superclass.

Abstraction: Understand abstraction by defining abstract classes and methods, providing a blueprint for concrete implementations.

Java Packages: Dive into Java packages, organizing classes into meaningful namespaces to manage project structure efficiently.

Using the Scanner Class: Discover how to take user input using the Scanner class, enabling interaction between the program and the user.

Synchronized Methods: Explore synchronization in Java by synchronizing methods to ensure thread safety in multithreaded applications.

Usage
Each Java file is self-contained and can be compiled and executed individually. You can navigate to the specific folder containing the concept you want to study, and then compile and run the corresponding Java file. For example, to run the EncapsulationDemo.java file:

shell
...........
#######
Copy code
cd java/encapsulation
javac EncapsulationDemo.java
java EncapsulationDemo
